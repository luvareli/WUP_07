### Data is from the Patient_Info dataset from South Korea 1 Jan to 1 May 2020
### This data was retrieved from a downloadable zip file from kaggle

Some of the data was uncoded for sex - sex must be just male or female
77 of the data entries were coded sex  as blank, so we omit these.
state of a patient must be died or alive - we adjust that as well   


  
# Your Question - Is dying independent of sex?

## Methods

We will analyzed the sex of the patients and the result if they are alive or dead. I will the variables in my collection of Cat~cat. This is a type of problem that we can use that we can incorporate the helper file and copy into our project to gather the correct answer.








## Graphical results - use ggplot commands to do this  

#### Plot barplots ggplot way
```{r}
dd2 <- kRdata %>% group_by(result,Sex) %>% summarize(count=n()) %>% mutate(prcnt=count/sum(count))


# the group_by followed by summarize(count=n())

basicC <- ggplot(dd2,aes(x=result,y=count,fill=Sex))
basicC + geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge")

#Now for percentage plot

basicCC <- ggplot(dd2,aes(x=result,y=prcnt*100,fill=Sex)) 
basicCC + geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge")
```


In the counting chart I can see that not a lot of people people died. It is 50-70. In the percentage in the chart female is 50% is alive and male percentage is about 40%. there is more female than male, twice as many males were dying.





  
## Numerical results

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~result + Sex, data=kRdata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
In the percentage of the chart I can observe that more female are alive with the difference of 12. 36% of dead are female and 64% are male. In the second chart females are 98.7 and males are only 97. In the dead percentage females are 1.4% and males are 3%.
